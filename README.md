# UgandaEMR ESM

A microfrontend for UgandaEMR built on top of [OHRI](https://github.com/UCSF-IGHS/openmrs-esm-ohri) and OpenMRS 3.x

For more information on how to get started, please refer to the
[OpenMRS 3.x documentation](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/OpenMRS+3.0%3A+A+Frontend+Framework+that+enables+collaboration+and+better+User+Experience).

## Getting started

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:METS-Programme/esm-ugandaemr-core.git

# to install dependencies
yarn
# to run the dev server
yarn start
# OR to start on a specified port eg 5090
yarn start --port 5090
```

Once it is running, a browser window
should open with the OpenMRS 3 application. Log in and then navigate to
`/openmrs/spa`.
